# Formula-1-Data-Analysis-Using-Azure-Databricks

### Introduction
In this project, I have developed a solution architecture for a data engineering solution using Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Gen2 and Power BI. The dataset used is Formula 1 historical data from 1950 to 2019. Data is taken from https://ergast.com/mrd/

Databricks is a data analytics platform that uses Apache Spark for data engineering solutions. It is available as service in Microsoft Azure.
